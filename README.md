## Hello to the read me page
This repo contains two files<br>
*c.cpp and *vector.cpp, which both accomplish the same task of letting you input the name/surname<br>
 as well as the homework/exam marks and then calculates them either by average or by median using this<br>
 formula: final mark = 0.4*average/median + 0.6*exam<br>
 vector.cpp uses vectors and c.cpp uses dynamic arrays<br>
<br>
 You can generate marks as well as name and surname by running c.cpp or vector c.pp and pressing 0,<br>
 if you want to input name and surname you press 1 and do it by hand, after that you have the option to<br>
 generate homework and exam marks by pressing 0 or input them by hand by pressing 1,<br>
 if you want to finish inputing, on the starting screen you press 1 and then 'b',<br>
 then you get an option for your result to be counted either using you homework average score or<br>
 using your homework median, then you get an output<br>
