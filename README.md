## Hello to the read me page
This repo contains two files<br>
*c.cpp and *vector.cpp, which both accomplish the same task of letting you input the name/surname<br>
 as well as the homework/exam marks and then calculates them either by average or by median using this<br>
 formula:<br>  ![formula.png](https://github.com/Edukasas/Obj-programming/blob/V0.1/formula.png)<br>
 vector.cpp uses vectors and c.cpp uses dynamic arrays<br>
<br>
 You can generate marks as well as name and surname by running c.cpp or vector c.pp and pressing 0,<br>
 if you want to input name and surname you press 1 and do it by hand, after that you have the option to<br>
 generate homework and exam marks by pressing 0 or input them by hand by pressing 1,<br>
 if you want to finish inputing, on the starting screen you press 1 and then 'b',<br>
 then you get an option for your result to be counted either using you homework average score or<br>
 using your homework median, then you get an output<br>

 with *vector.cpp you can input data by reading a file as well as output the data into a file<br>
 You have an ability to sort the data by name, surname and final result<br>
 I have read and outputed 3 files, first file was composed of <b>10,000</b> objects, second - <b>100,000</b>, third - <b>1,000,000</b> <br>
 ### first file took on average: <br>
 <b>0.224</b> secs to read <br> 
 <b>0.057</b> to output<br>
 ### second file took on average: <br>
 <b>2.57</b> secs to read <br>
 <b>0.54</b> to output<br>
 ### third file took on average: <br>
 <b>14.23</b> secs to read <br>
 <b>6.93</b> to output<br><br>
 There is an implementation of try/catch error handling as well as three new files containing functions/headers/libraries of original vector.cpp
 ## Experiment nr1 <br>
